The **Proxmox Hardening Guide** project provides structured, actionable recommendations to secure
**Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE 9.x & 8.x)** and **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS 4.x & 3.x)**.

These guides are designed for system administrators and security engineers who need
**step-by-step hardening instructions, compliance alignment with the CIS Debian Benchmark, and best practices for enterprise and homelab deployments**.

They extend the industry-recognized *CIS Debian Benchmark* with Proxmox-specific security tasks, practical examples, and real-world best practices.

## Safety first

Before you change anything:

- Create a recent backup or snapshot of the node and critical VMs or containers.
- Schedule a maintenance window so you can reboot if needed.
- Ensure you have out-of-band access (IPMI, iKVM, physical console).
- Record your current settings so you can restore them if required.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and open the guide you need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HomeSecExplorer/proxmox-hardening-guide.git
cd proxmox-hardening-guide/docs
```

## How to use these guides

1. **Start in a lab/staging node first** (or a single non-critical host).
2. Ensure you have **working backups** and **out-of-band/console access** before changing SSH, firewall, boot, or storage settings.
3. Apply controls **incrementally**:
   - Do **Level 1** first (lowest risk, highest baseline value).
   - Move to **Level 2** only when you understand the operational impact.
   - Apply Level 3 **only when needed**
4. After each change, **validate service health** (GUI access, SSH, storage, cluster status, backups, VM migration) and keep a rollback path.
5. Use the **Execution Status** checkboxes to track what’s applied per host, and record deviations with a short note.
